# Manning LiveProject Series on Building an IoT Management Platform with Vert.x by Philippe Charri√®re

In this series of liveProjects, you'll use the Vert.x Java toolkit to build a complete management platform for a home-based Internet of Things network. You'll take on the role of a developer for SmartHome, a company that manufactures Internet of Things devices that monitor and measure your whole household. Each project in this series will focus on creating a different standalone component of this network. Your challenges will include setting up simulations of IoT interconnectivity for testing, developing gateway software for data transmission, and creating a server that can aggregate data and transmit it to the platform backend.
