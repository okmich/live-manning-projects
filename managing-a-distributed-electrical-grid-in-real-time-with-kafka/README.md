# Managing a Distributed Electrical Grid in Real Time with Kafka with Jesse Yates
In this liveProject, you'll take on the role of a backend data engineer working for a rapidly growing startup. Your company installs battery packs for solar panels, as well as IoT devices monitor energy usage. These devices can help users and utilities companies better manage their energy, saving your customers money and providing clean power to the wider grid. Youâ€™ve been given a big task: build the infrastructure from the ground up that can handle the streaming events of thousands of these IoT devices. This infrastructure will be expected to scale as your company grows, and so your team has chosen to work with Apache Kafka for stream processing of all the data. Your challenges will include efficiently ingesting IoT events, managing corner cases in IoT data processing, developing fleet-wide monitoring, and providing REST services to answer questions about battery energy capacity.
