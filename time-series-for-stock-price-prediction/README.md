# Time Series for Stock Price Prediction
In this liveProject series, you play the part of a consultant whose client list includes prestigious financial institutions. One of them has hired you to improve the accuracy of their model for stock price prediction. Since most financial data include a time dimension, time series analysis is a hot topic in financeâ€”and an excellent application for this type of modeling. To help your client achieve their goal, you'll perform the essential steps in time series modeling including data preparation as well as model performance analysis and comparison. First you'll run classical moving average (simple MA and exponential MA), autoregressive (AR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Then you'll boost their performance by applying a hybrid approach that combines these models with deep learning models, leveraging the strengths of both. You'll also learn to visualize results and evaluate performance.
